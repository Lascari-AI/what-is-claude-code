Speaker notes:
- I've been in the trenches for 3 years - this isn't theoretical
- 30+ MVPs means I've seen EVERY way these systems fail
- 10+ in production means I know what survives contact with reality
- Your engineering instincts about testing, error handling, and architecture? They're MORE important with AI, not less
- I'm here because good engineers make the difference between toys and products
