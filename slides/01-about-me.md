Generative AI Engineer & Independent Consultant

<div>

### 3 years deep in generative AI
- Built **30+ MVPs** across every industry imaginable
- **10+ production systems** still running today
- Seen every failure mode: hallucinations, latency death spirals, context explosions
- **I know what breaks at 3am**

</div>
<div>

### What actually keeps AI systems alive?
- Proper error handling, not "try again" loops
- Structured outputs, not prayer-based parsing
- Async orchestration that scales beyond demos
- **The same engineering principles you already trust**

</div>

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

**Hard truth:** The difference between AI toys and AI products isn't the modelâ€”it's the engineering around it.

<!--
Speaker notes:
- I've been in the trenches for 3 years - this isn't theoretical
- 30+ MVPs means I've seen EVERY way these systems fail
- 10+ in production means I know what survives contact with reality
- Your engineering instincts about testing, error handling, and architecture? They're MORE important with AI, not less
- I'm here because good engineers make the difference between toys and products
