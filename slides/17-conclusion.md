This is your moment of choice.

You can resist. Many will. They'll cling to the way things were, dismiss AI as hype, hope it's a fad. History shows how that ends.

Or you can evolve. Not by abandoning your expertise, but by amplifying it. Not by becoming a "prompt engineer," but by becoming an AI-enhanced architect.

The irony is this: the engineers who fear AI most are often the ones who would benefit from it most. Your deep knowledge, your battle scars, your understanding of what actually matters in production - that's what makes you the perfect person to wield these tools responsibly.

The future needs engineers who understand both the power and the dangers of AI. Who can build systems that leverage AI while maintaining human judgment. Who can prevent the disasters that pure automation would create.

That engineer could be you. If you choose to evolve.

The choice is yours. Choose wisely.
