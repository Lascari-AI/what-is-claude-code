<!--
Your most valuable skill becomes your ability to create a clear, detailed plan.
This shift has a profound impact on our role as engineers. We spend less time on the mechanical act of writing code and more time on the high-level architecture and planning. Your ability to break down a problem and write a clear, unambiguous plan becomes your most valuable skill. Because a great plan is a great prompt for your agent.
