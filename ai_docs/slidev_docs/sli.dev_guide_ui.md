## Presenter Mode [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/ui\#presenter-mode)

To enter the presenter mode, you can click the  button in the navigation panel, or visit `http://localhost:<port>/presenter`.

When giving a presentation, it's recommended to open two browser windows - one in the play mode for the audience, and another one in the presenter mode for you. Then you can share the first screen to the audience and keep the second screen for yourself.

Whenever you navigate through the slides in the presenter mode, all other opened pages will automatically follow this navigation to stay in sync with the presenter.
