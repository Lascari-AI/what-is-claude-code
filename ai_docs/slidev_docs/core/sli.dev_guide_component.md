# Components in Slides [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/component\#components-in-slides)

One of the most powerful features of Slidev is the ability to use Vue components directly in your slides. This allows you to create interactive and dynamic content with ease.

## Using Components [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/component\#use)

With the help of [`unplugin-vue-components`](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-vue-components), Slidev allows you to use Vue components directly in your slides without importing them manually:

md

```
# My Slide

<MyComponent :count="4"/>
```

The components come from:

- Built-in components. See [Built-in Components](https://sli.dev/builtin/components) for reference.
- Provided by the theme and addons. See ðŸ“– Theme & Addons
[ðŸ“– Theme & Addons](https://sli.dev/guide/theme-addon)
.
- Custom components in the `components` directory. See the next section.

## Writing Components [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/component\#write)

To create a custom component, simply create a new Vue file in the `components` directory:

bash

```
your-slidev/
  â”œâ”€â”€ ...
  â”œâ”€â”€ slides.md
  â””â”€â”€ components/
      â”œâ”€â”€ ...
      â””â”€â”€ MyComponent.vue
```

Refer to the [Vue documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) for how to write Vue components.
