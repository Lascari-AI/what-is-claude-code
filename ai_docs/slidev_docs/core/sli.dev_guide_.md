# Getting Started [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/\#getting-started)

Slidev (slide + dev, **/slaÉªdÉªv/**) is a web-based slides maker and presenter. It's designed for developers to focus on writing content in Markdown. With the power of web technologies like Vue, you are able to deliver pixel-perfect designs with interactive demos to your presentation.

TIP

You can learn more about the rationale behind this project in ðŸ“– Why Slidev

[ðŸ“– Why Slidev](https://sli.dev/guide/why)

.

## Create Slides [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/\#create-slides)

### Try it Online [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/\#try-it-online)

Start Slidev right in your browser with StackBlitz: [sli.dev/new](https://sli.dev/new)

### Create Locally [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/\#create-locally)

> Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18.0 installed.

Run the following command to create a new Slidev project locally:

pnpmnpmyarnbun

bash

```
# If you haven't installed pnpm
npm i -g pnpm

pnpm create slidev
```

bash

```
# Not recommended -
# NPM will download the packages each time you create a new project,
# which is slow and takes up a lot of space

npm init slidev@latest
```

bash

```
yarn create slidev
```

bash

```
bun create slidev
```

Follow the prompts to start your slides project. The slides content is in `slides.md`, which initially includes demos of most the Slidev features. For more information about the Markdown syntax, please check ðŸ“– Syntax Guide

[ðŸ“– Syntax Guide](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax)

.

Single file usage (not recommended)

If you prefer to have a single Markdown file as your slides, you can install the Slidev CLI globally:

pnpmnpmyarnbun

bash

```
pnpm i -g @slidev/cli
```

bash

```
npm i -g @slidev/cli
```

bash

```
yarn global add @slidev/cli
```

bash

```
bun i -g @slidev/cli
```

Then, you can create and start a single file slides via:

bash

```
slidev slides.md
```

## Basic Commands [â€‹](https://sli.dev/guide/\#basic-commands)

Slidev provides a set of commands in its CLI. Here are some common ones:

- `slidev` \- Start the dev server. See [the dev command](https://sli.dev/builtin/cli#dev).
- `slidev export` \- Export the slides to PDF, PPTX, or PNGs. See ðŸ“– Exporting
[ðŸ“– Exporting](https://sli.dev/guide/exporting)
.
- `slidev build` \- Build the slides as a static web application. See ðŸ“– Hosting
[ðŸ“– Hosting](https://sli.dev/guide/hosting)
.
- `slidev format` \- Format the slides. See [the format command](https://sli.dev/builtin/cli#format).
- `slidev --help` \- Show the help message

To run these commands, you can add them to your `package.json` scripts (which has been done for you if the project was created via `npm init slidev`):

package.json

json

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "slidev --open",
    "build": "slidev build",
    "export": "slidev export"
  }
}
```

Then, you can simply run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, and `npm run export`.
