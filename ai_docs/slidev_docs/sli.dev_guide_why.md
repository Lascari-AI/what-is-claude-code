# Why Slidev [​](https://sli.dev/guide/why\#why-slidev)

There have been lots of feature-rich WYSIWYG slides makers like [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint) and [Apple Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/) _(see [Comparisons](https://sli.dev/guide/why#comparisons))_. They are intuitive and easy to learn. So why bother making Slidev?

Slidev aims to provide flexibility and interactivity for **developers** to make their presentations much more interesting, expressive, and attractive by using technologies they are familiar with. Slidev is also open source with a strong community.

Slidev is Markdown-based, which helps you **focus on the content**. Slidev is also Web-based, which means **nothing is impossible** \- everything you can do in a web app can apply to your slides.

Slidev is also **progressive**. You can start with a super simple Markdown file, and then use the [built-in features](https://sli.dev/features/) when you need them without any configuration. There are also [themes and addons](https://sli.dev/guide/theme-addon) you can optionally install to enhance your slides.
